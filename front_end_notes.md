Converted Single Simulation page to flex box, looks a little cramped. 
I think Adding the initial head position might help fill out some of the space.

## TODO
- Add inital head position to div containing starting sequence.
- Add padding to 3 column divs in single page view to make them taller / wider
- Try setting max height for graph container.
